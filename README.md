Beau Roi - Group C Interns - HR Data Analytics Project🎯 

Project Objective :
The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of internal HR data covering 500 employees across multiple departments. 

The focus is to identify key patterns in employee engagement, satisfaction, attrition, absenteeism, burnout risk, training effectiveness, and performance trends. 

By leveraging data profiling, correlation analysis, visualization, and query-driven insights, the project delivers a strategic HR dashboard and recommendation reports. 

These outputs are designed to empower HR leadership with data-driven decisions, enabling proactive interventions, improved employee retention, and enhanced organizational well-being.


Deliverables Completed ✅ :

Deliverable 1 : Data Profiling Report – Dataset overview, structure, and quality check.

Deliverable 2 : Correlation analysis – Employee Metrics Heatmap and Correlation insights

Deliverable 3 : Key Insights Report – Highlights of major findings from the dataset.

Deliverable 4 : HR Analytics Dashboard – Interactive Power BI dashboard.

Deliverable 5 : 6 Page Executive Summary Report – Strategic recommendations for HR leadership.


Challenges Completed ✅ :

✅ Challenge 1: Departmental Comparison and Tailored Solutions

We normalized engagement, absenteeism, and performance scores across all departments. Heatmaps were created to highlight gaps, and the Management department was flagged as “at risk” due to low engagement and high absenteeism. Tailored, department-specific recommendations were provided.

✅ Challenge 2: 6 page Strategic HR Report

A 6-page recommendation report was developed, summarizing findings on engagement, satisfaction, burnout, and attrition. The report identified the top 3 engagement drivers (satisfaction, training, recognition), highlighted red-flag departments (Sales, Technical, Support, Operations), and proposed 3 targeted interventions with an implementation roadmap for HR leadership.

✅ Challenge 3: SQL Query Library

A mini SQL query library was built to support HR analytics tasks. It includes queries for attrition trends, absenteeism by department, tenure segmentation, training attendance, high performer burnout risk, and engagement analysis. Outputs were validated and compiled into a reference report.
